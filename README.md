CipherByte Technologies Projects

This repository contains the projects assigned to me by CipherByte Technologies as part of my responsibilities. The projects included in this repository are:

1. Iris Flower Classification
This project loads the Iris dataset, visualizes it, and splits it into training and testing sets. It trains a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier and evaluates the model using accuracy and confusion matrix visualizations. Finally, the project includes making predictions on new samples.

2. Unraveling Unemployment
The Unraveling Unemployment project is a data analysis project focused on exploring and understanding unemployment trends. It involves analyzing a dataset containing information about unemployment rates across different demographics, regions, and time periods. The project aims to uncover insights and patterns within the data to better understand the factors influencing unemployment and inform policy decisions.
