CipherByte Technologies Projects

This repository contains the projects assigned to me by CipherByte Technologies as part of my responsibilities. The projects included in this repository are:

1. Iris Flower Classification
This project loads the Iris dataset, visualizes it, and splits it into training and testing sets. It trains a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier and evaluates the model using accuracy and confusion matrix visualizations. Finally, the project includes making predictions on new samples.

2. SPAM EMAIL DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
This project builds an email spam detector using Python. It preprocesses the dataset, visualizes the distribution and common words in spam and ham emails, and trains a Naive Bayes model. The model is then evaluated for accuracy and performance, and a function is provided to classify new emails as spam or ham.
